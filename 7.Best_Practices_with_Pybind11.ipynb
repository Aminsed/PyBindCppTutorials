        "1. **Code Organization**: We emphasized the importance of separating the binding code from the actual C++ implementation. This ensures clarity and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is crucial. We explored how to handle errors in the C++ code and translate them into Python exceptions using pybind11, ensuring that Python users receive meaningful error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Testing Your Code**: Before binding C++ code to Python, it's essential to test the C++ implementation thoroughly. We demonstrated how to write unit tests using the Google Test framework and provided a CMake configuration for compiling and running the tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these best practices, developers can create robust, efficient, and user-friendly Python modules backed by C++ implementations. This approach allows for the best of both worlds: the performance of C++ and the ease of use of Python."
