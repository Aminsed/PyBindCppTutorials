## Introduction to Pybind11

Pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the Boost.Python library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time introspection.

The main issue with Boost.Python—and the reason for creating such a similar project—is Boost. Boost is an enormously large and complex suite of utility libraries that works with almost every C++ compiler in existence. This compatibility has its cost: arcane template tricks and workarounds are necessary to support the oldest and buggiest of compiler specimens. Now that C++11-compatible compilers are widely available, this heavy machinery has become an excessively large and unnecessary dependency.

Think of this library as a tiny self-contained version of Boost.Python with everything stripped away that isn't relevant for binding generation. Without comments, the core header files only require ~4K lines of code and depend on Python (2.7 or 3.x, or PyPy2.7 >= 5.7) and the C++ standard library. This compact implementation was possible thanks to some of the new C++11 language features (specifically: variadic templates, lambda functions and rvalue references). It will probably not work with compilers that do not support these features, but then again, it's 2023 and almost all compilers do.

## Usage

Pybind11 can be used to create Python bindings for C++ code, which allows C++ code to be called from Python. This can be useful for several reasons:

- C++ is generally faster than Python, so if you have performance-critical code, it can be beneficial to write that code in C++ and then call it from Python.
- If you have existing C++ code that you want to use in a Python project, you can use Pybind11 to create bindings for that code, rather than having to rewrite it in Python.
- Pybind11 can be used to create Python extensions, which are modules written in C++ that can be imported into Python.
