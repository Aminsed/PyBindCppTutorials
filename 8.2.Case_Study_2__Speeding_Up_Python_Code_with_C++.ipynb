        "`pybind11` is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. By integrating C++ with Python using `pybind11`, we can achieve the following benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Performance Boost**: C++ is generally faster than Python, especially for computationally intensive tasks. By offloading these tasks to C++, we can speed up our Python applications.\n",
        "2. **Leverage Existing C++ Libraries**: There are many powerful C++ libraries out there. With `pybind11`, we can easily use these libraries in our Python projects.\n",
        "3. **Type Safety**: C++ is a statically-typed language, which can help catch type-related errors at compile time rather than runtime.\n",
